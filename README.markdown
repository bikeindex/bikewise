Bike Incident mapping data by [Bike Index](https://bikeindex.org/)!

BikeWise is a place to learn about and report bike crashes, hazards, and thefts. This project intends to provide a powerful, universal way to access biking incident data for data scientists and developers.

BikeWise has an open, RESTful API. **[Check out the documentation page](https://bikewise.org/documentation)**

Every day incidents for the past 30 days are committed to [geojson_data/recent incidents.geojson](geojson_data/recent%20incidents.geojson) and all incidents are committed to [geojson_data/all.geojson](geojson_data/all.geojson). Both are geojson FeatureCollections, generated by [calling the locations endpoint of the API](geojson_export.sh).

### Report sources

Right now we're importing Bike Index thefts and [SeeClickFix](http://seeclickfix.com/) reports that pertain to biking, but we're excited about importing more report sources in the future.

Adding new import strategies is simple - so if you've got a bunch of incident data you'd like to add, hit us up, <contact@bikeindex.org>!


### Running it locally

This is a [Rails 4.1](http://rubyonrails.org/) app run on [Ruby 2.1](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (we use [RVM](https://rvm.io/)) with PostgreSQL and [redis](http://redis.io/). It's a very similar stack to Bike Index ([which has more detailed set up instructions](https://github.com/bikeindex/bike_index)).

You can start the server in development with `rake start` - it will open on [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/).
